# Voxel Grid filter
# Downsamples the data by taking a spatial average of the points in the cloud
#   confined by each voxel. The set of points which lie within the bounds of
#   a voxel are assigned to that voxel and are statistically combined into
#   one output point.

# Create a Voxel Grid filter object for the input point cloud
vox = cloud.make_voxel_grid_filter()

# Choose a voxel size (also known as leaf size) of n cubic meters per voxel
LEAF_SIZE = 0.01

# Set the voxel (or leaf) size; can adjust size along each dimension

# PassThrough filter
# Allows a 3D point cloud to be cropped by specifying an axis with cut-off
#   values along that axis. The region allowed to 'pass through' is often
#   called the 'region of interest.'

# RANSAC plane segmentation
# Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is used to identify points in the dataset
#   that belong to a particular model. It assumes that all of the data in a
#   dataset is composed of both inliers and outliers, where inliers can be
#   defined by a particular model with a specific set of parameters, where
#   outliers don't and can be discarded.

# Create the segmentation object
seg = cloud_filtered.make_segmenter()

# Set the model to be fitted
seg.set_model_type(pcl.SACMODEL_PLANE)
seg.set_method_type(pcl.SAC_RANSAC)

# Max distance for a point to be considered fitting the model

# Call segment function to obtain set of inlier indices and model coefficients

# Extract inliers
# Extract the points from the point cloud from using the inliers list of
#   indicies. This will isolate the table from the point cloud.

# Setting the negative flag to False filters for the table
